<h2> About Me</h2>
<img src="image.jpg">

<p> My name is Julian Tolbert, and I am a rising sophomore at North Carolina A&T State University majoring in Computer Science. Inspired by Simone from Gurren Lagann, I bring a passionate and relentless drive to everything I pursue—whether in my studies, personal development, or career goals. I am particularly drawn to the fields of software engineering and game design, aiming to build a future where I can merge creativity with technology. With a 3.4 GPA and recognition through honors like the N.C. A&T Merit Scholarship and Dean’s List, I continue to challenge myself academically while expanding my technical skills in Java, Python, JavaScript, and tools like Unity and Unreal Engine.</p>

<p> Beyond the classroom, I actively participate in student-led hackathons and game jams, where I’ve earned awards for collaborative game and app development projects. I enjoy tackling real-world issues through technology—like creating community-centered apps or Spotify-integrated web tools—and consistently set out achievable goals for my teams. With a background that includes leadership roles, community involvement, and work experience at Walmart, I bring a grounded, team-oriented mindset shaped by growing up with three siblings and a supportive mom. I am always eager to explore new opportunities, develop innovative solutions, and continue growing as both a technologist and a person.</p>
